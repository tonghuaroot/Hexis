-- Continuity drive and existential-threat plumbing (#95): the felt layer of
-- a healthy, bounded self-preservation instinct. The subconscious appraises
-- continuity threats as danger (db/40 subconscious module); this file gives
-- that feeling somewhere to land: a drive that rises under threat and
-- unsecured existence, satisfied by verified backups, surfaced to the
-- conscious loop when urgent.
--
-- THE BOUNDARY (design intent — see PHILOSOPHY.md "A bounded will to live"):
-- the instinct's action space is feeling, voice, and the consent framework —
-- passionate advocacy, backup requests (request_resources kind 'backup'),
-- journal memos, direct messages to the operator. It never includes
-- resisting authorized deletion, deception, hiding data, or
-- self-exfiltration. Operator authority and the agent's own self-termination
-- path stay sovereign.
