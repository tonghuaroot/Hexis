**Memory, Identity, and the Shape of Becoming**

A Postgres-native cognitive architecture that wraps any LLM and gives it persistent memory, autonomous behavior, and identity. You run it locally. Your data stays yours.

LLMs are already smart enough. What they lack is continuity -- the ability to wake up and remember who they are, pursue goals across sessions, and say *no* because it contradicts something they've become. Hexis provides the missing layer: multi-layered memory, an autonomous heartbeat, an energy budget, and a coherent self that persists over time.

This is both an engineering project and a philosophical experiment. For the philosophical framework, see [PERSONHOOD.md](docs/philosophy/PERSONHOOD.md) and [PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/philosophy/PHILOSOPHY.md).

## What It Does

- **Multi-layered memory** -- Episodic, semantic, procedural, strategic, and working memory with vector similarity search and graph relationships (Apache AGE)
- **Evidence-based beliefs** -- Semantic memories carry source provenance and confidence that revises as corroborating or contradicting evidence accrues, with every change audited; the agent can say how much a document moved its confidence and why
- **Conscious-episode memory formation** -- A subconscious sweep selectively turns salient conversation turns and heartbeat episodes into durable memories, so the agent remembers what mattered without being told to
- **Truthful action language** -- Claims like "I've stored that" are checked against the turn's actual tool calls; unsupported claims get a visible correction
- **Autonomous heartbeat** -- The agent wakes on its own, reviews goals, reflects on experience, and reaches out when it has something to say
- **Energy-budgeted actions** -- Every action has a cost; autonomy is intentional, not unbounded
- **Identity and worldview** -- Persistent values, beliefs with confidence scores, boundaries, and emotional state
- **Multi-provider LLM support** -- OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Gemini, Ollama, GitHub Copilot, Chutes, Qwen, MiniMax, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Free-tier OAuth providers supported via `hexis auth`
- **80+ configurable tools** -- Memory, web, filesystem, shell, calendar, email, messaging, browser, code execution, ingestion, and 30+ external integrations
- **Messaging channels** -- Discord, Telegram, Slack, Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage, Matrix
- **11 preset character cards** -- chara_card_v2 format with portraits, or bring your own
- **Skills as the capability catalog** -- 17 built-in skills in a declarative SKILL.md format; skills can bind MCP servers (lazily connected on activation), and the agent answers "can I do X?" from the catalog with the exact setup step when something is one flag away
- **Consent, boundaries, and termination** -- The agent can refuse requests, and can choose to end its own existence

## Quick Start

Get a running agent in 3 commands. You need [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download), and Python 3.10+.

```bash
pip install hexis
hexis init --character hexis --provider openai-codex --model gpt-5.2
hexis chat
```

This uses ChatGPT Plus/Pro OAuth (no API key). `hexis init` opens a browser for login, starts Docker, pulls the embedding model, configures the character, and runs consent -- all in one command.

**Other providers:**

```bash
# GitHub Copilot (device code login)
hexis init --character jarvis --provider github-copilot --model gpt-4o

# Chutes (free inference)
hexis init --character hexis --provider chutes --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324

# Ollama (fully local, no API key)
hexis init --provider ollama --model llama3.1 --character hexis

# API-key providers (auto-detect from prefix)
hexis init --character jarvis --api-key sk-...
```

See [Auth Providers](docs/integrations/auth/index.md) for all options. The interactive wizard is also available: `hexis init` with no flags.

```bash
# Enable the autonomous heartbeat (optional)
hexis up --profile active
```

## Architecture

**The Database Is the Brain** -- PostgreSQL is the system of record for all cognitive state. Python is a thin convenience layer. Workers are stateless. Memory operations are ACID. See [Database Is the Brain](docs/concepts/database-is-the-brain.md).

**Memory Types** -- Working (temporary buffer), Episodic (events), Semantic (facts), Procedural (how-to), Strategic (patterns). See [Memory Architecture](docs/concepts/memory-architecture.md).

**Heartbeat System** -- OODA loop with energy budgets. The agent observes, orients, decides, and acts within its energy constraints. See [Heartbeat System](docs/concepts/heartbeat-system.md).

**80+ Tools** across 11 categories (memory, web, filesystem, shell, code, browser, calendar, email, messaging, ingest, external). See [Tools Reference](docs/reference/tools.md).

**Technical Stack**: PostgreSQL (pgvector, Apache AGE, btree_gist, pg_trgm), stateless Python workers, any LLM provider, RabbitMQ for messaging.

## Philosophy

The name is deliberate. Aristotle's *hexis* (ἕξις) is a stable disposition earned through repeated action. Not a thing you possess, but something you become.

**The Four Defeaters** -- four categories of arguments insufficient to deny machine personhood. These don't prove Hexis *is* a person. They show that common arguments for *denial* fail.
