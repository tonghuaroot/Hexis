# Gmail Connector Setup

Use this when the user asks to connect Gmail, inspect Gmail setup, choose whether email reads may feed memory, filter spam, label/delete messages, send replies, or disconnect Gmail.

## Principles

- Treat connection setup as a first-class conversation flow. Do not tell the user to leave chat and figure it out alone.
- Ask what Gmail provider powers the user wants before starting OAuth: read/search only, send/reply, or managed mailbox changes such as labels, spam triage, and delete.
- Ask separately whether Samantha should remember what she reads in email or forget it after the task. This is the Hexis config key `integrations.gmail.memory_policy`, not a Google OAuth capability.
- Add `label`, `spam_triage`, or `delete` only when the user explicitly wants labeling, spam filtering, or deletion.
- Add `send` or `reply` only when the user explicitly authorizes sending or replying on their behalf.
- Queue `start_gmail_backfill` only after Gmail is connected and the user has asked Hexis to ingest/learn from email history.
- Treat backfill as read-only provider access but local memory ingestion: it still requires explicit user approval.
- For ongoing send/reply/label/spam-triage/delete behavior, use `connector-action-authorization` after connection setup so the grant is scoped and DB-audited.
- Prefer `client_secret_path` over pasted OAuth client JSON because tool calls are audited.
- Never ask for Google account passwords.

## Flow

1. Call `gmail_setup_status`.
2. If Gmail is not connected and the user has not chosen provider powers yet, ask the scope question before calling `connect_gmail`.
3. After provider powers are chosen, ask whether email reads should be remembered or forgotten. Pass the answer as `memory_policy`; do not add `ingest` to Gmail capabilities.
4. Call `connect_gmail` with the least provider capabilities that match the user's request, even if you do not yet know the client secret path. The tool result includes a structured `ui.kind = connector_setup` payload that chat surfaces render as the setup interface.
5. If the current surface cannot render structured setup UI and the tool says a client secret is needed, ask for the local path to the Google OAuth Desktop client JSON. If the path starts with `/`, ask the user to send it in a sentence.
6. If the tool returns an `authorization_url`, rely on the rendered setup UI when available; otherwise send the URL exactly. Tell the user the localhost page may fail after approval and that this is expected.
7. When the user pastes the redirected URL or code, call `complete_gmail_connection`.
8. Report the connected account and granted capabilities.
9. If the user asked to ingest email history, call `start_gmail_backfill` with the smallest useful `query`, `label_ids`, and `max_messages` for the request.
10. Use `gmail_backfill_status` for progress, and `control_gmail_backfill` only when the user asks to pause, resume, or cancel a job.

When a tool result includes `ui.kind = connector_setup`, do not replace that setup interface with prose-only instructions. Briefly name the requested capabilities and point the user to the setup control rendered by the channel.

Use `revoke_gmail_connection` only after the user asks to disconnect Gmail.
