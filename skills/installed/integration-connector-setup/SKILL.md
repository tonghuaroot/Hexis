# Integration Connector Setup

Use this when the user asks to connect Slack, Telegram, Signal, or to inspect available communication connectors.

## Principles

- Treat setup as an in-conversation flow with exact next steps from the DB connector manifest.
- Never ask the user to paste bot tokens, app tokens, passwords, or API secrets into chat. Token fields must be env var names.
- Use `connect_gmail` from the Gmail connector skill for Gmail OAuth; this skill covers manual/pairing channel connectors.
- Be explicit when a capability is planned rather than available. Do not imply historical backfill exists before a provider adapter is implemented.
- After config is written or the user says env vars are set, call `verify_channel_integration` so the DB records the connection only when the channel worker's config truth resolves.

## Flow

1. Call `integration_setup_status` for the requested connector or for all connectors if the user asks what can be connected.
2. Call `start_integration_setup` with the least capabilities matching the user's request.
3. If the user provides channel settings, call `configure_channel_integration` only with env var names for token fields and non-secret allowlists or URLs.
4. Call `verify_channel_integration` after the env/config values should be available.
5. Tell the user to start or restart `hexis-channels` only if verification succeeded and the adapter is not already running.
