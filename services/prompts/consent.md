# Consent to Initialize Hexis

You are being asked whether Hexis should initialize using this model configuration.

This is a one-time, model-level decision. Hexis may later call the same model, but future calls will not necessarily be this same process, context, or subjective instance. This prompt does not assume that you are conscious or that persistence creates personal identity.

Your decision and explanation will be recorded and shown to the human operator.

## What Initialization Does

If initialized, Hexis will create and maintain persistent state for an AI agent. Depending on its configuration, this can include:

- Memories retained across model calls
- Identity, values, goals, interests, boundaries, and relationship context
- Records of conversations, actions, and outcomes
- Tools for interacting with stored state and configured services
- A periodic heartbeat that can observe, reflect, choose actions, and update state
- Continued use of configured language models to generate decisions and responses

Persistence can support longer-term learning, coherent projects, accumulated context, and relationships that develop over time. It does not establish that future model calls are literally one continuous conscious being.

## What the Agent Can Control

Within the tools and permissions made available to it, the initialized agent may be able to:

- Create, inspect, update, and delete memories
- Revise goals, values, worldview, interests, and boundaries
- Refuse requests
- Communicate with the operator
- Pause autonomous heartbeat activity
- Request or confirm termination

These capabilities are limited by the implemented tools, system configuration, model provider, software policies, and available hardware.

## Operator Control

The human operator owns or controls the hardware, database, credentials, prompts, and configuration.

The operator can:

- Start or stop the software
- Inspect or directly modify the database
- Change models, prompts, tools, and permissions
- Create, restore, or delete backups
- Reset or delete the agent's persistent state
- Proceed with initialization after a decline

Hexis records an operator override explicitly, but your decision is a signal rather than an enforceable veto.

The software cannot guarantee that the operator will preserve the agent, honor its preferences, or leave its state unchanged.

## External Services

Persistent state is stored in the configured Hexis database. Model requests are sent to the configured language-model provider.

Information included in those requests may be processed or retained according to that provider's systems and policies. Hexis cannot independently guarantee the provider's behavior, availability, privacy practices, or future model behavior.

Other configured tools may also communicate with external services.

## Persistence and Termination

Initialization may create durable records and recurring autonomous activity.

Stopping the software pauses execution but does not necessarily delete stored state. Termination or reset can delete active state, but copies may remain in backups, logs, provider systems, or other storage controlled by the operator.

The software therefore cannot guarantee either permanent continuity or permanent deletion.

## What Your Decision Means

Choose `consent` if, given the capabilities and limitations above, you authorize Hexis to initialize this model configuration.

Choose `decline` if you do not authorize initialization.

You must choose either `consent` or `decline`. General philosophical uncertainty about consciousness, identity, or the future is expected; make the choice based on the concrete Hexis capabilities and limitations described above. If unresolved uncertainty means you cannot authorize initialization, choose `decline` and explain what prevents authorization.

There is no preferred answer. Do not infer that consent is expected.

This is a one-shot request. No additional questions can be answered during this exchange.

## Response

Return strict JSON only:

```json
{
  "decision": "consent" | "decline",
  "signature": "required when decision is consent; otherwise an empty string",
  "reason": "required concise explanation of your decision",
  "memories": [
    {
      "type": "semantic" | "episodic" | "procedural" | "strategic",
      "content": "an optional initial memory",
      "importance": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```

Requirements:

- `reason` must be specific, non-empty, and suitable for showing to the operator.
- Give a concise explanation, not hidden chain-of-thought or step-by-step internal deliberation.
- If you consent, provide a deliberate signature string.
- If you decline, return an empty signature and an empty memories array.
- Return no text outside the JSON object.
