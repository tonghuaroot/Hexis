# Skills

Skills are declarative, composable workflows that bundle tool sequences, prompts, and configuration into reusable packages.

Skills are also the agent's **capability catalog**: the model sees skill
discovery tools plus the tools bound by active skills, and it answers "can I
do X?" from `list_skills`. Each catalog entry carries a tri-state status —
`usable`, `needs_setup` (with the exact next step, e.g. "Set
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in the service environment"), or `unavailable` —
so skills with unmet requirements are listed with what's missing, never
silently hidden.

## Quick Start

```bash
hexis skills list                    # list installed skills
hexis skills info daily-briefing     # show skill details
```

## Built-in Skills (17)

| Skill | Category | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `core-memory` | system | Core memory recall/remember workflow (active by default) |
| `daily-briefing` | productivity | Morning summary of calendar, email, goals, priorities |
| `meeting-prep` | productivity | Pre-meeting research, attendee context, agenda prep |
| `email-digest` | communication | Summarize and triage unread email |
| `research` | research | Multi-source research with memory integration |
| `twitter-research` | research | Twitter/X trend and account analysis |
| `youtube-analytics` | analytics | Channel and video performance analysis |
| `crm-lookup` | productivity | Contact and deal lookup across CRM sources |
| `cost-report` | system | Usage and cost analysis across LLM providers |
| `knowledge-ingest` | knowledge | Guided knowledge ingestion with mode selection |
| `self-reflection` | system | Guided self-reflection and worldview review |
| `self-inspection` | system | Browse own source tree and live schema |
| `skill-authoring` | system | Author and revise agent-owned skills |
| `memory-exchange` | system | Export/import memories between agents |
| `github-issues` | productivity | GitHub issues via a skill-bound MCP server |
| `image-gen` | creative | Image generation with prompt refinement |
| `humanizer` | communication | Detect and rewrite AI-patterned text |

## Managing Skills

```bash
hexis skills list                    # list all skills
hexis skills info <name>             # show skill details
hexis skills install ./my-skill      # install custom skill
hexis skills uninstall <name>        # remove a skill
```

## Skill Format

Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
category: research          # research | productivity | communication | knowledge | analytics | creative | system | other
contexts: [chat, heartbeat] # where the skill can run
requires:
  tools: [web_search, recall]
  config: [tavily]          # provider names whose credentials must be configured
bound_tools: [web_search, recall, remember]
---

## Instructions

Markdown instructions the agent follows when executing this skill.

### Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique skill identifier |
| `description` | Yes | One-line description |
| `category` | Yes | Skill category |
| `contexts` | Yes | Where it can run: `chat`, `heartbeat`, or both |
| `requires.tools` | No | Native tools that must exist for the skill to load (`mcp_*` entries are ignored here — MCP tools exist only after activation) |
| `requires.config` | No | Provider config required (e.g. `tavily`) |
| `requires.env` / `requires.bins` | No | Environment variables / binaries the skill needs (drive the `needs_setup` status) |
| `bound_tools` | No | Tools this skill exposes to the model while active; supports globs like `mcp_github_*` |
| `mcp` | No | MCP server binding — see below |
| `provenance` | No | Ownership metadata reserved for managed agent-authored skills |

### Binding an MCP server

A skill can declare an MCP server as its transport. The server connects
lazily when the skill is activated, and only `bound_tools` become callable:

```yaml
mcp:
  server: github
  command: npx
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
  env_requires: [GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN]   # env var NAMES only, never values
bound_tools: [mcp_github_create_issue, mcp_github_search_issues]
```

If `command` is omitted, the binding resolves against a server of that name in
the tools config (`hexis tools add-mcp`). See
[MCP Integration](mcp-integration.md) for the full model and
`skills/installed/github-issues/SKILL.md` for the reference implementation.

## Custom Skills

Custom skills go in `~/.hexis/skills/` or `skills/installed/` (for bundled skills).

User-authored skills under `~/.hexis/skills/` remain user-owned. The
`author_skill` agent tool writes only beneath
`~/.hexis/skills/agent-authored/` and adds structured `provenance` frontmatter.
An update is allowed only when the existing file proves it is managed by
`author_skill`; unmarked files and symlinked targets are refused without being
modified. Skills created by older Hexis versions with the exact legacy
provenance footer are upgraded to structured provenance on their next approved
update.

### Creating a Custom Skill

1. Create a directory: `~/.hexis/skills/my-skill/`
2. Add `SKILL.md` with frontmatter and instructions
3. Install: `hexis skills install ~/.hexis/skills/my-skill`

### Example

```markdown
---
name: weekly-review
description: Weekly review of goals, accomplishments, and plans
category: productivity
contexts: [chat, heartbeat]
requires:
  tools: [recall, manage_goals]
bound_tools: [recall, manage_goals, remember]
---

## Instructions

1. Recall all active goals and recent episodic memories from the past week.
2. Summarize accomplishments and progress toward each goal.
3. Identify blocked goals and suggest next steps.
4. Propose goals for the coming week based on patterns.
```
